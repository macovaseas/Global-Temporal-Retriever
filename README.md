This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of the **(GTR)** — a lightweight, plug-and-play module designed to empower any multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) model with the ability to capture global periodic patterns far beyond the fixed look-back window.

## 🌟 Key Innovation: The Global Temporal Retriever (GTR)

Existing MTSF models are fundamentally limited by their reliance on a fixed-length historical window, making them unable to capture crucial global periodic patterns (e.g., weekly, monthly, seasonal trends) that span cycles much longer than the input.

**GTR solves this by**:
1.  **Maintaining a Learnable Global Representation**: A parameter matrix `Q ∈ R^(L×N)` encodes the entire global cycle pattern for all `N` variables.
2.  **Dynamic Retrieval & Alignment**: For any input sequence, GTR identifies its position within the global cycle and retrieves the corresponding segment.
3.  **Joint Local-Global Modeling**: The retrieved global segment is stacked with the local input and processed by a 2D convolution to model dependencies across both scales.
4.  **Seamless Integration**: The enriched representation is fused back via a residual connection, making GTR compatible with *any* existing forecasting backbone (MLP, Transformer, Mamba, etc.) without architectural changes.

## 📈 Performance Highlights

*   **State-of-the-Art Results**: GTR+MLP achieves SOTA performance on 6 real-world datasets for both short-term and long-term forecasting.
*   **Significant Gains**: On the challenging Solar-Energy dataset, GTR outperforms the second-best model by **8.2% in MSE** and **6.5% in MAE**.
*   **Plug-and-Play Enhancement**: GTR consistently improves diverse SOTA models (iTransformer, PatchTST, DLinear) by up to **91.9% MSE reduction** (DLinear on PEMS04).
*   **Extreme Efficiency**: The GTR module itself adds only **40.1K parameters** and **4.50M MACs**. The full GTR+MLP model uses just **0.98M parameters**, which is only 19% of iTransformer's size.
